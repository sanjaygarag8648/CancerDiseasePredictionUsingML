#  Cancer Disease Prediction using ML

This project aims to develop a web application for predicting the likelihood of cancer based on Human Symptoms and features using Django, a Python web framework.

## Features

- Prediction of cancer likelihood based on input features.
- User-friendly web interface for inputting data and viewing predictions.

The "Getting Started" section provides step-by-step instructions for someone who wants to set up and run your Django app locally. It covers cloning the repository, installing dependencies, configuring the database settings, running migrations, and starting the development server.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cancer-disease-prediction.git

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd cancer-disease-prediction

5. Install the required dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
7. Run migrations:
   
   python manage.py migrate
   
9. Start the development server:
    
   python manage.py runserver
   
11. Access the application at http://localhost:8000.
